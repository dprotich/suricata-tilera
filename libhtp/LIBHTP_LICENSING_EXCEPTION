LIBHTP LICENSING EXCEPTION
===============================

Version 1.0, 6 January 2010

As a special exception ("Exception") to the terms and conditions of version 2
of the GPL, Ivan Ristic hereby grants you the rights described below, provided
you agree to the terms and conditions in this Exception, including its
obligations and restrictions on use.


Exception Intent
================

We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS") programs to be
able to use LibHTP (the "Program") despite the fact that not all FLOSS
licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the
"GPLv2").


Legal Terms and Conditions
==========================

You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from the
Program and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or
more of the licenses listed below in section 1, as long as all of the
following conditions are met:

  1. You obey the GPLv2 in all respects for the Program and the Derivative
     Work, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are
     
     1. not derived from the Program, and
     
     2. are not designed to interact with the Program, and
     
     3. which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in
        themselves.
        
  2. All such identifiable sections of the Derivative Work are
  
     1. distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and
     
     2. the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied
        by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those
        sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the
        corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections.
        
  3. Any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative Work
     on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with the
     GPLv2, can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in
     themselves which are not derivatives of either the Program, a Derivative
     Work or a FLOSS Work, and are not designed to interact with the Program.
     
If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be copied,
modified, distributed or used under the terms and conditions of the GPLv2
or another valid licensing option from Ivan Ristic.

Due to the many variants of some of the above licenses, we require that for
any version of the listed FLOSS licenses to qualify under this exception, it
must follow the 2003 version of the Free Software Foundation's Free Software
Definition (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or version 1.9 of the
Open Source Definition by the Open Source Initiative
(http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php).


Definitions
===========

1. Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the
   version 2 of the GPL.
   
2. Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright law.


Applicability
=============

This Exception applies to all Programs that contain a notice placed by Ivan
Ristic saying that the Program may be distributed under the terms of
this Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is a Derivative Work
of both the Program and any other work licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS
Exception is not available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS
Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all respects,
including by retaining all GPL notices.

You may choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under the
terms of the GPLv2 by removing the Exception notice from that copy of the
Program, provided that the copy has never been modified by you or any third
party.
