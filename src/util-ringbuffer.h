/** When the ringbuffer is full we have two options, either we spin & sleep
 *  or we use a pthread condition to wait.
 *
 *  \warning this approach isn't working due to a race condition between the
 *           time it takes for a thread to enter the condwait and the
 *           signalling. I've obverved the following case: T1 sees that the
 *           ringbuffer is empty, so it decides to start the wait condition.
 *           While it is acquiring the lock and entering the wait, T0 puts a
 *           number of items in the buffer. For each of these it signals T1.
 *           However, as that thread isn't in the "wait" mode yet, the signals
 *           are lost. T0 now is done as well and enters it's own wait
 *           condition. T1 completes it's "wait" initialization. It waits for
 *           signals, but T0 won't be able to send them as it's waiting itself.
